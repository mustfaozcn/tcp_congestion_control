# BMT5111 - Performance Analysis of Computer Networks

This repository contains the Python code developed for the course BMT5111 - Performance Analysis of Computer Networks. 

The primary objective of this project is to extract, analyze, and visualize the performance metrics of TCP traffic. We use Python and its powerful libraries such as Scapy for packet manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization.

The metrics evaluated in this project include:

- Packet Loss Rate
- Throughput
- Average Round-Trip Time (RTT)

These metrics are extracted and computed from packet-level data stored in a PCAP file which is recorded using TShark. 

This project serves as an introduction to the tools and techniques that can be used to understand and evaluate the performance of computer networks. It is a valuable resource for anyone interested in network performance analysis or looking to incorporate Python programming into their network analysis toolbox.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries such as Scapy and Matplotlib.
3. Run the Python script provided.
